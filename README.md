# smartMoneyMovement

In this I analysed FII DII smartMoney movement using python/pandas
analysed positions of bigPlayrs by using OI data from NSE site

Took datas from https://www.nseindia.com/all-reports-derivatives
downloaded few .csv files(searched participant wise datas)

process: 1.create a folder, keep all the .csv files there, create another folder inside the folder named "RESULT"
	 2. create 4 .csv files there  FII.csv, DII.csv, PRO.csv, CLIENT.csv
	 3. our code will append over these 4 .csv and will give us datas after analysing.
